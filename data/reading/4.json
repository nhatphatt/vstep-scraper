        "content": "Câu 1: According to the geoscientists, when were the continents assumed to first rise above the oceans?\nA. 3 billion years ago\nB. 2 billion years ago\nC. 4 billion years ago\nD. 1 billion years ago\nCâu 2: What is true about the continents?\nA. They rise about four miles above the seafloor.\nB. Their crust is five times thicker than the ocean floor crust.\nC. Their crust is dense and has average thickness.\nD. They are made of thick and underlying crust.\nCâu 3: What can be claimed about the time continents were formed?\nA. It is subject to argument.\nB. It is put forward in a contest.\nC. It was dated from the earliest days.\nD. It is beyond human’s knowledge.\nCâu 4: What does the phrase “To shed light on” in paragraph (A) mean?\nA. To release\nB. To clarify\nC. To illustrate\nD. To ignite\nCâu 5: According to the passage, how was the crust of the seafloor formed?\nA. Through tectonic compression.\nB. Through continental erosion.\nC. Through silica deposition.\nD. Through volcanic activity.\nCâu 6: What happens when magma cools and crystallizes?\nA. The volume of silica in rock extends.\nB. Rubidium volume gradually plunges.\nC. The molten rock diminishes in silica.\nD. Strontium’s volume boosts.\nCâu 7: What can be inferred from the sentence “The thick, buoyant nature of these chunks of crust would have made them rise high above what became the seafloor” in paragraph (B)?\nA. The seafloor is composed of comparatively thin crust.\nB. The thick and floating crust rose lower than what made the seafloor.\nC. The thick and buoyant chunks of crust are the cause of seafloor rising.\nD. Floating crust supported the continents to rise from the oceans.\nCâu 8: What is “accompanying” in paragraph (C) closest in meaning to?\nA. Concurrent\nB. Supplementary\nC. Cooperating\nD. Following\nCâu 9: What can be concluded from the passage about the appearance of continental crust about 3 billion years ago?\nA. The moment plate tectonics began properly marked the appearance of continental crust.\nB. No theory can be propo",
